    <h5>Early-Stage Startups (Seed Financing / Pre-Revenue)</h5>
    <p>
      You need to get product built and into market quickly. You need flexible
      resources who can adapt as your business evolves and finds a fit in the
      market. Building out an internal team takes time and money, and commits
      you to a high-burn rate. Wattcode can give you speed to market and
      flexibility that you need, while allowing you to selectively add internal
      team members as the business grows.

    <h5>Scaling Startups (Series A / Series B / Rapid-Growth)</h5>
    <p>
      Building a team takes time, and money. In many cases it can take three to
      six months to hire and on-board a new employee. In hot job markets, a
      shortage of tech talent means potentially compromising hiring standards,
      and escalating salaries. Using various recruiting sites and headhunters
      can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, money that could
      be invested in building new product or acquiring more customers.
