        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>
          Effective, efficient testing is critical to the success of software
          projects. Wattcode's Testing Services provide the option for manual or
          automated functional testing of new or existing applications across a
          wide variety of technologies and platforms. Testing Services are
          bundled with Delivery Management to ensure efficient, effective
          utilization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing Services can be combined with Wattcode Development services or
          engaged on a stand-alone basis. This can be particularly useful for
          organizations with in-house developers but without dedicated testing
          or QA staff.

          teams. Our DevOps Services provide the capability to create test and
          staging environments, enable automated code build, test automation and
          deployment systems, infrastructure automation, and monitoring and
          logging solutions. Our DevOps Services can be applied to a number of
